// Package log contains the Logger interface and various helper functions for
// logging.
//
// After they instantiated an appropriate logger adapter, it should be enough
// for most applications to rely on the types and functions defined in package
// log exclusively.
//
// Some applications may have very simple logging needs. For those cases
// package log provides a very basic writer logger.
